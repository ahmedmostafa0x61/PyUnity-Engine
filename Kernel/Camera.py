"""
    This is the camera module. the camera is used to render the scene from a specific point.

    the camera has:
        Position, Rotation that control the POV of the game
        Near, Far that control how far the camera will render
        Size that control how wide the camera is. it also works a zooming lens.

    during the game control only position and rotation to avoid any errors.
